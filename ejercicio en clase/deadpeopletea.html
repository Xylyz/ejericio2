    <h1>DEAD PEOPLE TEA</h1>
    <h2>Is not as bad as it sounds</h2>
    <P>Have you been told that you resemble a black cat-might be because of your attitude or physical 
        appearance-, a golden retriever or an aggressive chihuahua? Well, some people have <em>a thing</em>
        but instead of animals they resemble plants, and some of them are very aromatic with very calming 
        properties.
    </P>
    <p>Letâ€™s see one of my first clients-to which I asked permission beforehand, of course- that wanted 
        to keep a little bit of their mother. She was a sweet lady whose demeanor and soothing presence 
        put at ease even the most hot tempered individual. Her name was Amelia. Following the nature of 
        her spirits it is only fitting to plant chamomile so she can keep the peace of her surviving family, 
        and thus the Chamomelia tea batch came to be.

    <p>All my tenants have a special place in my grove. I keep them well hydrated with enough light 
        according to their type of plant, and the solid is kept with a perfect acidity.
    </p>
    <p>I am certified professional in the management of any organic material for recycling, so you 
        can rest assured that your loved one will be handled with the most attentive and gentle care.
    </p>
    <p>This is a picture of the gove, where all my tenants and plants are kept secured and loved.
